# Automated Validation Report

Date: 2025-09-28

This report was generated by an automated repository validation that checks for the presence and minimal quality of key runtime and domain artifacts. Each check is annotated with PASS/WARN and evidence paths or snippets.

## Summary

- Checks run: 12
- PASS: 10
- WARN: 1
- FAIL: 0

Key findings:
- The Docker-based runtime is present and correctly wired: `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `docker/entrypoint.sh`, and `docker/app-healthcheck.sh` are present and contain the expected bootstrap logic.
- Core domains (Booking, Media, Payments) have controllers, models, jobs, services and migrations present.
- Tests exist for core features but at least one important feature test (`CreateBookingTest.php`) is a placeholder and skipped; CI/test harness likely needs configuration.

## Checks (details)

1. docker-compose.yml exists — PASS

Evidence:

`/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/docker-compose.yml`

Snippet:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    entrypoint: ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
    command: ["php", "artisan", "serve", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=8000"]
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "/usr/local/bin/app-healthcheck.sh"]
```

Recommendation: None.

2. Dockerfile exists & base image — PASS

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/Dockerfile` — uses `FROM php:8.2-fpm` and installs required extensions and Composer.

3. Entrypoint script — PASS

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/docker/entrypoint.sh`

Snippet (high level):

```
# Validates required env vars, waits for DB/Redis, generates APP_KEY if missing, runs migrations with retries, creates /tmp/app.ready
```

Recommendation: Keep migration timeouts/locks in mind for production; consider a separate migration job rather than running on container start in clustered environments.

4. App healthcheck — PASS

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/docker/app-healthcheck.sh` checks /tmp/app.ready and hits `/healthz`.

5. Compose healthcheck configured — PASS

Evidence: `docker-compose.yml` healthcheck for app service referencing `app-healthcheck.sh`.

6. Booking controller exists — PASS

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/app/Http/Controllers/Site/BookingController.php` (`create()` and `store()` present). The `store()` method delegates to `CreateBookingAction` and handles exceptions.

7. CreateBookingAction — PASS

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/app/Actions/Bookings/CreateBookingAction.php` — contains transactional booking creation with a MySQL stored-procedure fallback and a lockForUpdate branch for general usage.

8. Bookings migration — PASS

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/database/migrations/2025_02_01_040000_create_bookings_table.php` — defines uuid, unique indexes and appropriate foreign keys.

9. Booking feature test — WARN

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/tests/Feature/Bookings/CreateBookingTest.php` contains a placeholder skipped test (markTestSkipped).

Recommendation: Enable/implement an integration test that runs with the Laravel testing harness in CI. Set up Docker-based test runner or use GitHub Actions with services to run tests against MySQL/Redis.

10. Media ingest job — PASS

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/app/Jobs/Media/IngestMediaJob.php` — does virus scan, marks status, and dispatches `TranscodeJob` to `media` queue.

11. StripeService — PASS

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/app/Services/Payments/StripeService.php` — creates intents and syncs payment intents.

12. Queue & filesystems config — PASS

Evidence: `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/config/queue.php` includes redis connection; `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/config/filesystems.php` defines `s3` and `media` disks.

## Overall recommendations

1. Implement/enable the skipped booking feature test and wire up a reproducible test harness in CI.
2. Consider splitting migrations from container startup for production to avoid contention and ensure smoother deployments.
3. Add a small non-blocking nightly E2E run that uses Dusk/Cypress + Axe for accessibility (Phase G plan references this).

## Artifacts

- Machine-readable results: `validation-reports/automated_validation_report.json`
- Human-readable summary: `validation-reports/automated_validation_report.md` (this file)

If you want, I can scaffold the CI job to run the tests with Docker services, or implement the missing booking test. Which would you prefer next?
