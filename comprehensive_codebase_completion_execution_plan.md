## Executive Alignment

- **Mission:** Deliver a trust-first, accessible platform that converts prospective caregivers into booked visits, while safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring operational resilience.
- **Primary KPIs:** Conversion funnel completion, booking API latency, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, uptime ≥ 99.9%, accessibility validation throughput.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Vertical slices per phase, immutable deployments, canary releases, documented rollback procedures (`Project Requirements Document v2.md` §4, §11).

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Accessibility by Default:** Conform to WCAG 2.1 AA with progressive enhancement and inclusive UX research in every phase.
- **Security & Privacy:** Execute compliance decision flow in Phase A, enforce RBAC, encryption, and audit logging (`Project Requirements Document v2.md` §7, §17).
- **Observability & Operations:** Instrument metrics, logs, and traces concurrently with feature work. Maintain runbooks and alert thresholds (`Project Requirements Document v2.md` §10, §16).
- **Incremental Value Delivery:** Ship deployable increments with end-to-end functionality and validation per phase acceptance criteria.
- **Data Model Fidelity:** Keep migrations/models consistent with `database_schema_mysql_complete.sql` to ensure referential integrity and concurrency safeguards.

---

## Program Governance & Workstreams

- **Roles:** Product Owner, Lead Developer, DevOps/Observability Engineer, Security Lead, QA Lead, UX Researcher, Media Engineer, Legal/Compliance Officer, Support/Operations Lead (`Project Requirements Document v2.md` §19).
- **Sprint Cadence:** 2-week sprints; each sprint delivers 1–2 vertical slices; embed validation reviews at phase boundaries.
- **Cross-Phase Tracks:** Accessibility, security, testing automation, and documentation evolve continuously with clearly assigned owners.
