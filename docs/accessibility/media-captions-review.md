# Phase D Media Accessibility Review

**Date:** 2025-09-24 (UTC+08)  
**Reviewer:** Accessibility Lead  
**Scope:** Caption coverage, transcript availability, focus handling, and keyboard/AT interoperability for media experiences (virtual tour, testimonial player).

---

## Checklist Summary
- **Captions Present:** ✅ All seeded hero, gallery, and testimonial videos reference VTT caption files and load by default.
- **Transcript Access:** ⚠️ Transcripts not yet published alongside videos. Logged backlog item `PHASE-D-ACCESS-06` (target Phase E) to generate downloadable transcripts.
- **Keyboard Controls:** ✅ Player controls reachable via keyboard. Tested in Chrome (Win) and Safari (macOS).
- **Screen Reader Labels:** ✅ `<video>` elements announce as "Video player" with descriptive figcaptions. Recommend adding `aria-label` once transcripts are available.
- **Focus States:** ✅ Custom Tailwind focus utilities applied; focus ring visible on play, volume, and fullscreen buttons.
- **Error Handling:** ⚠️ Missing captions file not surfaced to users. Add toast / inline message if `track` fails to load (backlog `PHASE-D-ACCESS-07`).

---

## Testing Notes
- VoiceOver + Safari: Confirmed caption toggle accessible; announcements mention "Captions on" when enabled.
- NVDA + Firefox: Video controls enumerated correctly; skip-link brings focus to main content before player.
- Mobile TalkBack (Android): Double-tap gestures work; however, transcript link absence observed (recorded in backlog).

---

## Recommendations
1. Publish textual transcripts in addition to VTT captions (Phase E deliverable).
2. Instrument frontend to surface caption loading errors for fallback messaging.
3. Add automated accessibility test (Pa11y/Axe) to assert caption tracks exist for every featured media item.

## Sign-off
- **Accessibility Lead:** Pending transcript backlog closure.  
- **Product Owner:** Requires awareness of follow-up items before Phase D exit sign-off.
