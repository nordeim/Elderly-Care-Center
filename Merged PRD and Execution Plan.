## 1. Executive summary

This document merges and improves the original Project Requirements Document and Execution Plan into a single, actionable artifact for engineering, QA, DevOps, and stakeholders. It keeps the original product vision (warm, trustworthy, accessible digital presence for elderly adult day services), hardens NFRs, inserts explicit privacy/compliance controls, defines observability and release practices, and provides a conservative, test-first phased delivery schedule with clear acceptance criteria and checklists.

Goals in one line: deliver a WCAG‑compliant, secure, scalable web platform that enables discovery, trusted evaluation (media & testimonials), and reliable booking/enrolment workflows for elderly day services.

---

## 2. Project overview & goals

**Purpose:** Build a modern, responsive, accessible platform for an elderly daycare provider to present services, host trusted storytelling media, enable bookings/enrolments, and provide a simple admin for non-technical staff.

**Primary objectives:**

* Convert site visitors to bookings and inquiries
* Provide clear trust signals (staff profiles, tours, testimonials)
* Ensure high accessibility and usability for older adults and their caregivers
* Operate securely and respect personal data privacy
* Deliver a maintainable codebase and repeatable deployment pipeline

**Success metrics (example targets):**

* Online booking conversion rate: 5%+ (baseline subject to stakeholder)
* Mobile bounce rate reduction: -15% vs baseline
* Page load: median < 2s (mobile), 95th percentile < 4s
* Accessibility: WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA compliance (automated + manual audit)
* Uptime target: 99.9% (monthly)
* Critical alert time-to-acknowledge: < 15 minutes

---

## 3. Personas & user journeys

**Persona summaries:**

* **Family caregiver** (40–65): researches services, books visits, reads pricing and schedules.
* **Prospective adult client** (65+): wants reassurance, friendly UX, clear media and staff info.
* **Referral agency / social worker**: verifies credentials, downloads resources.
* **Admin / center staff**: manages bookings, uploads media, runs reports.

**Primary journeys (high level):**

1. Discovery → Service Page → Virtual Tour / Testimonials → Book a Visit (one-click CTA)
2. Admin: Login → View Dashboard → Manage Bookings → Export reports
3. Caregiver: Register (optional) → View booking confirmations, receive reminders

---

## 4. Scope & prioritized features (phases)

**Phase 1 (MVP — Discovery + Booking):**

* Public site: Home, About, Services, Facility Tour, Staff, Testimonials
* Booking: Request booking / slot list, basic confirmation email
* Admin: CRUD for Services, Staff, Media, Bookings
* Accessibility baseline & SEO

**Phase 2 (Trust & Media):**

* Rich media gallery, video testimonials, virtual tour
* Testimonials & certifications management
* Enhanced booking conflict checking and waitlist

**Phase 3 (Accounts & Notifications):**

* Client/caregiver accounts and booking history
* Email + SMS reminders, calendar integration (iCal, Google)

**Phase 4 (Payments & Scale):**

* Payment/deposit flows (Stripe) if required
* Analytics dashboard, multi‑region media delivery (CDN)

**Phase 5 (Polish & Compliance):**

* Accessibility & security audits, pen tests
* Production hardened CI/CD, observability, runbooks

---

## 5. Technical architecture & stack (recommended)

**Reference stack:**

* Backend: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.4) — OR a framework the team prefers; keep API-first design
* DB: MariaDB 11.x (or PostgreSQL if preferred)
* Frontend: Tailwind CSS + Blade + Livewire / Alpine (progressive enhancement)
* Containerization: Docker for dev; Docker images for CI/CD; K8s for production if needed
* Media: Object storage (S3-compatible) + CDN for HLS delivery
* Auth: Laravel Sanctum for API, Spatie roles & permissions
* Observability: OpenTelemetry traces, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, Sentry for errors
* Caching/session: Redis
* Search: Simple DB search for MVP, Elastic/OpenSearch later if needed

**Design considerations:** API-first layers, horizontal stateless web nodes, externalized session store, media offload to object storage + CDN.

---

## 6. Non-functional requirements (NFRs) & SLOs

**Performance:**

* Median page load (mobile): < 2s
* Time-to-first-byte (TTFB): < 500ms for common pages
* API 95th percentile latency: < 300ms

**Availability:**

* Target uptime 99.9% (monthly)
* RPO (data loss tolerance): 4 hours; RTO (recovery): 2 hours for critical services

**Scalability:**

* Support horizontal scaling of web tier and separate media/CDN tier

**Maintainability:**

* Tests: Unit coverage target >= 70% for business logic; 90%+ on critical flows
* Coding standards and linting in CI

**Security & Privacy (high-level):**

* TLS 1.2+/HTTPS only; encryption at rest (AES-256) for sensitive data
* RBAC and audit logs for admin actions

---

## 7. Security & privacy (GDPR / HIPAA considerations)

**Principles:** Minimize sensitive data collection; protect PHI if stored/processed.

**Immediate actions (must have in merged doc):**

* Identify whether platform will store Protected Health Information (PHI). If yes, HIPAA controls must be applied (BAA with hosting vendor, logging, access controls, encryption, breach notification timelines).
* For EU/UK residents or if processing EU personal data: map data flows, privacy notice, lawful bases, data processing agreements, and data subject rights (GDPR).
* Define clear data retention and deletion policies (e.g., personal contact info retained X years after last activity unless consented otherwise).

**Technical controls:**

* TLS everywhere, strict-ciphers, HSTS
* Access control: least privilege, role separation
* Audit logging (who, what, when) for any view/modify of user/patient data
* Backup encryption and key management plan
* SAST (static analysis), DAST (dynamic scanning) as part of pipeline
* Schedule a 3rd‑party penetration test before launch (and annual thereafter)

**Operational:**

* Incident response plan and runbook, with P0/P1/P2 definitions, stakeholders and contact matrix
* Breach notification timelines aligned to regulatory obligations

---

## 8. Accessibility & UX standards

**Commitments:**

* Meet WCAG 2.1 AA baseline; prefer 2.2 AA where practical
* Mobile-first large typography (base 18–20px), logical focus order, skip-to-content, keyboard navigation
* Use ARIA roles diligently, alt text for images, captions & transcripts for videos

**Testing:**

* Automated axe-core checks in CI
* Manual keyboard and screen-reader audits each sprint
* Recruit 5–8 elderly users / caregivers for moderated usability testing during Beta

---

## 9. Observability, monitoring & incident response

**Metrics & Logs:**

* Expose request latency, error rates, booking throughput, queue length metrics
* Structured logs (JSON) shipped to centralized log store (ELK or managed alternative)
* Application traces (OpenTelemetry) for slow traces

**Dashboards & Alerts:**

* Grafana dashboards for service health
* PagerDuty (or OpsGenie) integration for P0/P1 alerts
* On-call rota, runbooks for common incidents

**Retention:**

* Logs: 30 days searchable; critical audit logs 1 year (configurable)

---

## 10. CI/CD, deployment & release strategy

**Pipeline (recommended):**

* GitHub Actions: lint → unit tests → build → containerize → integration tests → deploy to staging
* Promotion to production: manual approval + smoke tests + canary release (or blue/green)

**Deployment patterns:**

* Use blue/green for zero-downtime releases or canary for progressive rollouts
* Immutable releases (versioned docker images)
* Rollback scripts and automations

---

## 11. Testing & quality strategy

**Automated tests:**

* Unit tests for models and business logic
* Integration tests for API endpoints
* E2E tests (Cypress) for booking flows and admin CRUD
* Accessibility scans (axe) in CI
* Visual regression tests for critical pages

**Manual:**

* Usability sessions with elderly participants
* Accessibility manual audit
* Pre-launch security and penetration testing
* Load tests for booking endpoints and media pages (k6)

---

## 12. Integrations & APIs

**Priority integrations:**

* Calendar integrations: iCal/Google Calendar for booking exports
* SMS: Twilio or local SMS provider for reminders
* Email: transactional provider (SendGrid / SES) with templating
* Payment: Stripe (if deposits required) with PCI-DSS compliance via Stripe-hosted flows
* EHR / Wearables: plan FHIR-based APIs if clinical data exchange is needed; otherwise limit to summary numeric vitals and opt-in sharing

**Security for integrations:** API keys in secrets manager, least privilege tokens, TLS endpoints.

---

## 13. Offline resilience & PWA considerations

**Offline mode goals:** allow caregivers/staff to view cached schedules and patient notes in low-connectivity environments.

**Approach:**

* Progressive Web App for core read flows (service pages, booking forms caching)
* Background sync for queued booking submissions with robust conflict resolution

---

## 14. Phased execution plan (detailed)

**Philosophy:** vertical-slice delivery where each phase includes DB → API → UI → Tests → Staging deploy.

**High-level timeline (team of 2 devs + 1 designer + 1 QA):**

* Phase 0 (Foundation): 2–3 weeks
* Phase 1 (MVP — Content + Booking): 5–7 weeks
* Phase 2 (Trust & Media): 3–4 weeks
* Phase 3 (Accounts & Notifications): 4–6 weeks
* Phase 4 (Payments & Scale): 3–5 weeks
* Phase 5 (Polish & Compliance): 2–4 weeks

> Note: adjust calendar depending on team size and parallelization.

### Phase 0 — Foundation (deliverables & acceptance)

**Deliverables:** Code repo, docker dev env, basic CI skeleton, Laravel scaffold, base layouts.
**Acceptance:** `docker-compose up` serves app; CI passes lint & unit smoke tests.
**Checklist:** See integrated checklist section below.

### Phase 1 — MVP (deliverables & acceptance)

**Deliverables:** Public pages, booking flow, admin CRUD, initial accessibility fixes.
**Acceptance:** Users can complete booking flow end-to-end in staging; admin can CRUD services & bookings; automated e2e tests pass.

(Phases 2–5 include similar acceptance criteria tied to user outcomes, tests, and audits.)

---

## 15. Risks, assumptions & mitigations

**Top risks:**

1. Regulatory/compliance gap if PHI is stored — *Mitigation:* early data map and legal review.
2. Media (video) bandwidth costs and performance — *Mitigation:* use adaptive streaming + CDN.
3. Accessibility issues overlooked — *Mitigation:* axe in CI + manual audits + user testing.
4. Overly aggressive timeline — *Mitigation:* conservative estimate, minimal MVP scope.

---

## 16. Deliverables, signoffs & governance

**Artifacts to deliver per phase:** feature branch PRs, migration files, unit/integration/E2E tests, staging deploy, phase summary doc, accessibility & security checklists.

**Signoff process:** Product owner QA review → Accessibility reviewer → Security reviewer (if PHI) → Stakeholder acceptance.
