## 🛠 How to use the `Makefile`

A `Makefile` is a command shortcut system. You define tasks like `up`, `down`, `migrate`, and then run them with:

```bash
make up
make migrate
make restart
```

It saves you from typing long Docker commands and keeps your workflow consistent.

---

### 📦 Example `Makefile` for your Laravel stack

Create a file named `Makefile` in your project root with:

```makefile
up:
	docker compose up --build -d

down:
	docker compose down -v

restart:
	docker restart elderly-app

logs:
	docker logs -f elderly-app

migrate:
	docker exec elderly-app php artisan migrate

seed:
	docker exec elderly-app php artisan db:seed

tinker:
	docker exec -it elderly-app php artisan tinker

artisan:
	docker exec -it elderly-app php artisan

bash:
	docker exec -it elderly-app bash

health:
	curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/healthz
```

Then just run `make migrate` or `make logs` — no quotes, no flags, no fuss.

---

## 🧠 When to run `make migrate`

You run migrations when:

- You’ve added or modified a migration file in `database/migrations/`.
- You’ve pulled new migrations from Git.
- You’ve reset the database and need to rebuild schema.
- You’re deploying to a fresh environment.

In dev, you usually run it after code changes that affect the database:

```bash
make migrate
```

If you’re testing a new feature, you might also run:

```bash
make migrate
make seed
```

And if you want to wipe and rebuild:

```bash
make down
make up
make migrate
```

### 🧼 Pro tip: auto-migrate on container start

Your `entrypoint.sh` already runs `php artisan migrate` — so if you’re confident in your migration scripts, you don’t need to run it manually every time. But for safety, I recommend keeping `make migrate` handy for controlled runs.

Jeremiah, you’ve got the right idea — and with a few refinements, your dev workflow will be both efficient and safe. Let’s walk through it step by step and clarify what’s happening under the hood.

---

### ✅ Yes — with the override file in place:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./:/var/www/html:cached
```

Your **local codebase** at `/Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform` is **live-mounted** into the container. That means:

- Any code changes you make locally (controllers, views, routes, configs, etc.) are **instantly reflected** inside the container.
- You **do not need to rebuild the image** or re-run `docker compose up` for code changes.
- You **may need to restart the container** only if the change affects cached config, routes, or compiled views.

---

### 🔁 Refined dev workflow

Here’s a more precise version of your workflow:

#### 🧩 One-time setup (after adding override file)

```bash
docker compose down -v         # Stop and clean volumes
docker compose up --build -d   # Build and start with override active
```

This ensures:
- Fresh volumes (`storage/`, `public/`, `mysql-data`)
- Your local codebase is mounted into the container

---

#### 🔄 Iteration loop

```bash
# Step 3: Make code changes locally
# Step 4: Refresh Laravel if needed
docker exec elderly-app php artisan config:clear
docker exec elderly-app php artisan route:clear
docker exec elderly-app php artisan view:clear
```

You only need to restart the container (`docker restart elderly-app`) if:
- You change `.env` and want Laravel to reload it
- You modify something that’s cached and not cleared by artisan
- You want to re-trigger the entrypoint script (e.g. migrations, symlinks)

Otherwise, Laravel will pick up your changes instantly.

---

### 🧠 Pro tip: use `artisan serve` only in dev

If your container runs:

```bash
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

That’s fine for dev, but in production you’d switch to `php-fpm` behind nginx or Apache. Your override file is perfect for dev, so keep it isolated from production builds.

---

### 🧼 Final polish

- Add `.env` to `.dockerignore` and `.gitignore` so it’s never baked into the image or committed.
- Use `docker-compose.override.yml` only for local dev — exclude it from CI/CD.
- Consider adding a `Makefile` with shortcuts like:
  ```make
  up: docker compose up --build -d
  down: docker compose down -v
  restart: docker restart elderly-app
  logs: docker logs -f elderly-app
  migrate: docker exec elderly-app php artisan migrate
  ```

---

So yes — with the override active, your local edits are live in the container. You’ve built a clean, agent-friendly dev loop. Let me know if you want help wiring in hot-reload for frontend assets or a debug dashboard for Redis and MySQL.

---

Great question, Jeremiah — let’s break it down clearly.

### 🔍 Interpretation of the mapping

```yaml
app-storage:/var/www/html/storage
```

This is a **Docker volume mapping**, not a host path bind mount. It means:

- **`app-storage`** is a **named volume** managed by Docker.
- **`/var/www/html/storage`** is the **path inside the container** where that volume is mounted.

So:

- **Local (host):** `app-storage` is stored somewhere in Docker’s internal volume storage (not directly in `/Home1/project/...`).
- **Remote (container):** `/var/www/html/storage` is where Laravel writes logs, cache, sessions, etc.

---

### 🧠 Why this matters

- This mapping **does not** expose your local filesystem directly.
- It ensures Laravel’s `storage/` directory is **persisted across container rebuilds**, but **isolated from your host codebase**.
- It avoids permission issues and host/container drift — especially important for logs and cache files.

---

### 🧪 If you want to mount your actual local `storage/` folder

You’d use a bind mount like:

```yaml
- /Home1/project/elderly-daycare-platform/storage:/var/www/html/storage
```

But that’s **not recommended** unless you’re debugging storage behavior or need full transparency. The named volume (`app-storage`) is safer and cleaner for most dev workflows.

---

Let me know if you want to inspect or reset the contents of `app-storage`, or if you'd like to temporarily mount your local `storage/` for debugging. I can guide you through both.
