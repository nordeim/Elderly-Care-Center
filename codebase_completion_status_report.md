# Codebase Completion Status Report

**Project:** Elderly Daycare Platform  
**Report Date:** 2025-09-25 (UTC+08)  
**Reference Plan:** `comprehensive_codebase_completion_execution_plan.md`

---

## Executive Summary

- **Current Phase Alignment:** Phase C deliverables are largely implemented with foundational work from Phases A and B complete. Phase D has been initiated with reservation sweeper scaffolding and metrics exposure. Phases E‚ÄìG remain unstarted.
- **Confidence Level:** Moderate. Core booking flows, admin interfaces, and accessibility baselines exist, but automated tests are placeholders and Laravel bootstrap is unfinished, preventing end-to-end verification.
- **Immediate Priorities:** Finalize Phase C validation (tests, seeds, accessibility audit), complete Phase D media pipeline prerequisites, and ensure operational runbooks and observability are production-ready.

## Phase Progress Overview

| Phase | Planned Focus | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | Program Inception & Governance | ‚úÖ Completed | Governance docs, compliance mapping, CI bootstrap, secrets guidance in place (`docs/governance/roles-and-responsibilities.md`, `docs/compliance/data-map.md`, `.github/workflows/ci-bootstrap.yml`). |
| B | Foundation Platform & Authentication | ‚úÖ Completed (baseline) / ‚ö†Ô∏è Gaps | Authentication models, migrations, controllers done (`app/Models/User.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`); Docker/observability configs exist (`docker/docker-compose.yml`). Outstanding: Grafana dashboards, Ops documentation, full CI test harness. |
| C | Public Content & Booking MVP | ‚úÖ Major functionality | Public pages, admin booking inbox, booking flow, migrations delivered (`resources/views/pages/*.blade.php`, `app/Actions/Bookings/CreateBookingAction.php`, `database/migrations/2025_02_01_*.php`). Accessibility assets added (`public/css/accessibility.css`, `docs/accessibility/manual-audit-template.md`). Pending: email templates, browser/E2E tests, performance validation, moderation session evidence. |
| D | Media Pipeline & Trust Builders | üöß In Progress | Queue + sweeper scaffold, booking metrics, Prometheus job and docs (`app/Jobs/ReservationSweeperJob.php`, `app/Support/Metrics/BookingMetrics.php`, `ops/observability/prometheus/prometheus.yml`, `docs/observability/metrics.md`). Media ingestion services, storage config, and UI enhancements not started. |
| E | Accounts, Notifications & Calendars | ‚è≥ Not Started | No caregiver dashboards, notification jobs, or audit logging yet. |
| F | Payments, Analytics & Scale | ‚è≥ Not Started | Stripe, analytics dashboards, CDN infra pending. |
| G | Launch Hardening & Operations | ‚è≥ Not Started | Audits, runbooks, and go-live tooling not begun. |

## Detailed Findings by Phase

### Phase A ‚Äî Program Inception & Governance
- **Completed:** Governance matrix, compliance documents, secrets management README, developer bootstrap script, CI bootstrap workflow, quality gates doc.
- **Outstanding:** None for current scope; maintain risk register updates per plan.

### Phase B ‚Äî Foundation Platform & Authentication
- **Completed:** User/auth models with Sanctum, login controller with rate limiting, base routes, migrations for users/sessions/tokens, Docker and PHP images, basic Prometheus config.
- **Gaps:**
  - Grafana dashboards (`ops/observability/grafana/...`) and Terraform infra assets not yet created.
  - Tests (`tests/Feature/Auth/LoginTest.php`) and runbook updates for auth are missing or placeholders.
  - Laravel app bootstrap incomplete; tests cannot execute.

### Phase C ‚Äî Public Content & Booking MVP
- **Completed:**
  - Public discovery pages (`resources/views/pages/home.blade.php`, `services.blade.php`, `staff.blade.php`).
  - Booking form + request validation (`resources/views/pages/book.blade.php`, `app/Http/Requests/BookingRequest.php`).
  - Booking domain models/migrations (`app/Models/Booking*.php`, `database/migrations/2025_02_01_0*.php`).
  - Admin booking inbox + service/staff CRUD (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/*`, `resources/views/admin/bookings/index.blade.php`).
  - Accessibility baseline assets and manual audit template.
  - Seeders for facilities, services, staff, testimonials.
- **Gaps:**
  - Email notifications (`resources/views/emails/booking_confirmation.blade.php`) not yet created.
  - Automated tests remain skipped placeholders (`tests/Feature/Bookings/CreateBookingTest.php`, `tests/Feature/Accessibility/SkipLinkTest.php`).
  - No documented performance testing outcomes or moderated session logs.
  - Consent flows and privacy notice links not wired into UI.

### Phase D ‚Äî Media Pipeline & Trust Builders
- **Completed/In Progress:** Reservation sweeper job, queue config, failed jobs migration, booking metrics service and controller, Prometheus scrape job, observability docs, PHPUnit config and test harness scaffolding, metrics unit test (`tests/Unit/Metrics/BookingMetricsTest.php`).
- **Not Started:** Media ingestion/transcoding jobs, storage configuration, frontend media components, captioning guidelines, media tests.
- **Risks:** Without media pipeline, Phase D remains in early scaffolding; dependent trust content still missing.

### Phase E‚ÄìG
- No implementation yet. All deliverables, tests, and documentation remain outstanding per plan.

---

## Continuous Tracks & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Testing:** PHPUnit harness (`phpunit.xml`, `tests/TestCase.php`) added, but majority of feature tests are placeholders. Need Laravel bootstrap completion and real coverage.
- **Accessibility:** Skip-link and focus styles implemented; automated Axe CI still pending; manual audit template ready.
- **Observability:** Prometheus scraping extended; Grafana dashboards and alerting rules missing.
- **Documentation:** Several new docs exist (`docs/observability/metrics.md`, `docs/validation/reports/phase-c-accessibility.md`), but runbooks for booking/admin ops not authored.

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

- **Testing Coverage Gap:** Without executable tests, regressions may slip. *Mitigation:* Finish Laravel bootstrap, implement feature/unit tests across booking and admin flows, integrate into CI.
- **Media Pipeline Schedule Risk:** Significant Phase D deliverables remain; plan resource allocation and milestones before proceeding to Phase E.
- **Operational Readiness:** No runbooks for queue workers or booking inbox operations. *Mitigation:* Draft ops docs and verify on-call readiness before Phase D sign-off.
- **Security & Compliance Evidence:** Consent handling and privacy link integrations pending; ensure alignment with `docs/compliance/privacy-assessment.md` before production.

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Finalize Phase C Validation**
   - **Owner:** QA Lead / Lead Developer
   - Implement booking confirmation email, add accessibility + booking flow feature tests, run moderated sessions, and capture findings in `docs/validation/reports/phase-c-accessibility.md`.

2. **Advance Phase D Media Pipeline**
   - **Owner:** Media Engineer / DevOps
   - Scaffold media ingestion/transcoding services, configure storage and security controls, produce captioning guidelines, and add observability metrics.

3. **Strengthen Observability & Ops Runbooks**
   - **Owner:** DevOps Engineer
   - Create Grafana dashboards, alert definitions, and documentation for booking metrics and queue workers.

4. **Prepare for Phase E Entry**
   - **Owner:** Product Owner / Lead Developer
   - Define detailed scope, ensure notification providers and audit logging strategy ready before starting caregiver accounts.
