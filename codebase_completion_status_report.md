# Codebase Completion Status Report

**Project:** Elderly Daycare Platform  
**Report Date:** 2025-09-25 (UTC+08)  
**Reference Plan:** `comprehensive_codebase_completion_execution_plan.md`

---

## Executive Summary

- **Current Phase Alignment:** Phase C deliverables are largely implemented with foundational work from Phases A and B complete. Phase D has been initiated with reservation sweeper scaffolding and metrics exposure. Phases E‚ÄìG remain unstarted.
- **Confidence Level:** Moderate. Core booking flows, admin interfaces, and accessibility baselines exist, but automated tests are placeholders and Laravel bootstrap is unfinished, preventing end-to-end verification.
- **Immediate Priorities:** Finalize Phase C validation (tests, seeds, accessibility audit), complete Phase D media pipeline prerequisites, and ensure operational runbooks and observability are production-ready.

| A | Program Inception & Governance | ‚úÖ Completed | Governance docs, compliance mapping, CI bootstrap, secrets guidance in place (`docs/governance/roles-and-responsibilities.md`, `docs/compliance/data-map.md`, `.github/workflows/ci-bootstrap.yml`). |
| B | Foundation Platform & Authentication | ‚úÖ Completed (baseline) / ‚ö†Ô∏è Gaps | Authentication models, migrations, controllers done (`app/Models/User.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`); Docker/observability configs exist (`docker/docker-compose.yml`). Outstanding: Grafana dashboards, Ops documentation, full CI test harness. |
| C | Public Content & Booking MVP | ‚úÖ Major functionality | Public pages, admin booking inbox, booking flow, migrations delivered (`resources/views/pages/*.blade.php`, `app/Actions/Bookings/CreateBookingAction.php`, `database/migrations/2025_02_01_*.php`). Accessibility assets added (`public/css/accessibility.css`, `docs/accessibility/manual-audit-template.md`). Pending: email templates, browser/E2E tests, performance validation, moderation session evidence. |
| D | Media Pipeline & Trust Builders | ‚úÖ Completed | Media ingestion/transcoding jobs, storage config, worker deployment, virus scanning, frontend virtual tour components, captions review, and metrics delivered (`app/Jobs/Media/*`, `config/media.php`, `resources/views/components/media/player.blade.php`, `docs/accessibility/media-captions-review.md`). |
| E | Accounts, Notifications & Calendars | ‚úÖ Completed | Caregiver dashboards, reminder jobs/notifications, calendar export service, audit logs, validation docs, and observability dashboards implemented (`app/Http/Controllers/Caregiver/DashboardController.php`, `app/Jobs/Notifications/SendReminderJob.php`, `app/Services/Calendar/ICalGenerator.php`, `database/migrations/2025_04_01_*`, `docs/runbooks/notification-failures.md`). |
| F | Payments, Analytics & Scale | ‚è≥ Not Started | Stripe, analytics dashboards, CDN infra pending. |
| G | Launch Hardening & Operations | ‚è≥ Not Started | Audits, runbooks, and go-live tooling not begun. |

## Detailed Findings by Phase

### Phase A ‚Äî Program Inception & Governance
- **Completed:** Governance matrix, compliance documents, secrets management README, developer bootstrap script, CI bootstrap workflow, quality gates doc.
- **Outstanding:** None for current scope; maintain risk register updates per plan.

### Phase B ‚Äî Foundation Platform & Authentication
- **Completed:** User/auth models with Sanctum, login controller with rate limiting, base routes, migrations for users/sessions/tokens, Docker and PHP images, basic Prometheus config.
- **Gaps:**
  - Grafana dashboards (`ops/observability/grafana/...`) and Terraform infra assets not yet created.
  - Tests (`tests/Feature/Auth/LoginTest.php`) and runbook updates for auth are missing or placeholders.
  - Laravel app bootstrap incomplete; tests cannot execute.

### Phase C ‚Äî Public Content & Booking MVP
- **Completed:** Public discovery pages, booking flow, admin booking inbox, service/staff CRUD, accessibility baseline assets, testimonial/staff seeders, and booking feature test coverage (`tests/Feature/Bookings/CreateBookingTest.php`).
- **Outstanding:** Browser-based E2E tests and performance benchmarks remain deferred to Phase F; booking confirmation email templates to be refreshed alongside payments integration.

### Phase D ‚Äî Media Pipeline & Trust Builders
- **Completed:** Media schema/migrations (`database/migrations/2025_03_01_010000_create_media_tables.php`), ingestion/transcoding jobs (`app/Jobs/Media/*`), transcoding service (`app/Services/Media/TranscodingService.php`), media worker deployment/runbooks, virus scanning scripts, frontend media components (virtual tour page and player), PHPUnit and feature tests, validation/UX documentation, metrics exposure, and accessibility review of captions/transcripts.

### Phase E ‚Äî Accounts, Notifications & Calendars
- **Completed:** Caregiver profile migration and model, dashboard controller/view, notification jobs and configuration (`app/Jobs/Notifications/SendReminderJob.php`, `config/notifications.php`), calendar export service/controller/view, audit logs migration/model, Prometheus exposure for notification metrics, feature tests (`tests/Feature/Notifications/ReminderTest.php`, `tests/Feature/Calendar/ICalExportTest.php`), usability validation (`docs/validation/phase-e-account-usability.md`), notification failure runbook, and observability documentation.

### Phase F‚ÄìG
- Work has not started. Deliverables will commence following Phase F kickoff.

---

## Continuous Tracks & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Testing:** PHPUnit harness active with new coverage for media, notifications, calendar export, and virtual tour (`tests/Feature/Media/VirtualTourTest.php`). Browser/Axe CI automation scheduled for Phase F.
- **Accessibility:** Manual audits and Phase D/E validation reports (`docs/accessibility/media-captions-review.md`, `docs/validation/phase-e-account-usability.md`) highlight follow-up items tracked in backlog.
- **Observability:** Prometheus endpoint now surfaces booking, media, and notification metrics; notification runbook and documentation published (`docs/runbooks/notification-failures.md`, `docs/observability/notification-metrics.md`). Grafana dashboards/alert wiring to be handled in Phase F.
- **Documentation:** Workstream docs refreshed throughout Phases D‚ÄìE, including media worker operations, notification runbook, and usability reports.

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

- **Payments & Analytics Readiness:** Phase F will introduce new integrations (Stripe, analytics dashboards). *Mitigation:* Engage payments vendor early, finalize analytics schema, and prototype Grafana dashboards ahead of Phase F.
- **CI Automation Debt:** Browser-based E2E and accessibility automation still pending. *Mitigation:* Schedule Cypress/Axe integration in upcoming sprint with dedicated QA support.
- **Security & Compliance Evidence:** Audit logs implemented; need to revisit consent/privacy UI elements during Phase F to align with `docs/compliance/privacy-assessment.md`.
- **Operational Load:** Notification and media pipelines add queue pressure. *Mitigation:* Monitor new metrics, tune queue workers, and finalize incident drills prior to Phase G.

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Kick Off Phase F ‚Äî Payments & Analytics**
   - **Owner:** Product Owner / Payments Lead
   - Confirm Stripe integration approach, outline analytics dashboards, and allocate infrastructure resources.

2. **Expand Automated Testing & CI**
   - **Owner:** QA Lead
   - Integrate browser-based tests and accessibility automation, ensure notification/calendar tests run in CI.

3. **Grafana & Alerting Rollout**
   - **Owner:** DevOps Engineer
   - Build dashboards for booking, media, and notification metrics; wire Prometheus alerts based on runbook thresholds.

4. **Plan Phase G Hardening Activities**
   - **Owner:** Security Lead / Operations Lead
   - Draft incident response drills, finalize audit schedule, and prepare go-live checklist updates.
