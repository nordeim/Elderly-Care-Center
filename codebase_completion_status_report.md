## Detailed Findings by Phase

### Phase A ‚Äî Program Inception & Governance
- **Completed:** Governance matrix, compliance documents, secrets management README, developer bootstrap script, CI bootstrap workflow, quality gates doc.
- **Outstanding:** None for current scope; maintain risk register updates per plan.

### Phase B ‚Äî Foundation Platform & Authentication
- **Completed:** User/auth models with Sanctum, login controller with rate limiting, base routes, migrations for users/sessions/tokens, Docker and PHP images, basic Prometheus config.
- **Gaps:**
  - Grafana dashboards (`ops/observability/grafana/...`) and Terraform infra assets not yet created.
  - Tests (`tests/Feature/Auth/LoginTest.php`) and runbook updates for auth are missing or placeholders.
  - Laravel app bootstrap incomplete; tests cannot execute.

### Phase C ‚Äî Public Content & Booking MVP
- **Completed:** Public discovery pages, booking flow, admin booking inbox, service/staff CRUD, accessibility baseline assets, testimonial/staff seeders, and booking feature test coverage (`tests/Feature/Bookings/CreateBookingTest.php`).
- **Outstanding:** Browser-based E2E tests and performance benchmarks remain deferred to Phase F; booking confirmation email templates to be refreshed alongside payments integration.

### Phase D ‚Äî Media Pipeline & Trust Builders
- **Completed:** Media schema/migrations (`database/migrations/2025_03_01_010000_create_media_tables.php`), ingestion/transcoding jobs (`app/Jobs/Media/*`), transcoding service (`app/Services/Media/TranscodingService.php`), media worker deployment/runbooks, virus scanning scripts, frontend media components (virtual tour page and player), PHPUnit and feature tests, validation/UX documentation, metrics exposure, and accessibility review of captions/transcripts.

### Phase E ‚Äî Accounts, Notifications & Calendars
- **Completed:** Caregiver profile migration and model, dashboard controller/view, notification jobs and configuration (`app/Jobs/Notifications/SendReminderJob.php`, `config/notifications.php`), calendar export service/controller/view, audit logs migration/model, Prometheus exposure for notification metrics, feature tests (`tests/Feature/Notifications/ReminderTest.php`, `tests/Feature/Calendar/ICalExportTest.php`), usability validation (`docs/validation/phase-e-account-usability.md`), notification failure runbook, and observability documentation.

### Phase F ‚Äî Payments, Analytics & Scale
- **Completed:** Payment ledger migration/model, Stripe service, checkout + webhook controllers, hosted deposit view, feature tests (`tests/Feature/Payments/StripeFlowTest.php`), Stripe integration documentation, admin analytics controller/view, Grafana dashboard, metrics definitions, CDN Terraform module and staging config, CDN deployment runbook, load testing plan, and automation script.

### Phase G
- Work not started. Deliverables will commence after launch hardening kickoff.

---

## Continuous Tracks & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Testing:** PHPUnit harness now covers media, notifications, calendar export, payments, and admin analytics (`tests/Feature/Admin/AnalyticsDashboardTest.php`). Browser/Axe CI remains planned for Phase G with Cypress integration.
- **Accessibility:** Phase D/E audits documented; Phase F introduces payment UI accessible patterns. Outstanding tickets (e.g., ICS `aria-describedby`) scheduled for Phase G.
- **Observability:** `/metrics/booking` exposes booking, media, and notification counters; Grafana dashboard added for booking/payout funnel. Payment success/failure metrics integrated into Prometheus.
- **Documentation:** Payments, analytics, CDN, and load testing guides added. Runbooks now cover notification failures and CDN deployment.

## Key Risks & Mitigations

- **Launch Hardening Scope:** Phase G requires comprehensive audits (accessibility, penetration), runbooks, and incident drills. *Mitigation:* Allocate cross-functional team, schedule external assessments, and track exit criteria early.
- **CI Automation Debt:** Browser/Axe testing not yet automated. *Mitigation:* Phase G backlog includes Cypress + Axe pipeline, with ownership assigned to QA lead.
- **Compliance Evidence:** Payments integration must align with PCI SAQ A documentation. *Mitigation:* Update compliance artifacts and ensure Stripe configuration reviewed by security/compliance leads.
- **Operational Load:** CDN + payments increase infrastructure components. *Mitigation:* Monitor new dashboards, run load tests per plan, and finalize escalation runbooks before launch.

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Kick Off Phase G ‚Äî Launch Hardening & Operations**
   - **Owner:** Program Steering Committee
   - Schedule accessibility audit, penetration test, incident drills, and finalize go-live checklist.

2. **Automate Browser & Accessibility Testing**
   - **Owner:** QA Lead
   - Implement Cypress + Axe CI pipeline covering booking, caregiver, payments flows, and record results in Phase G validation docs.

3. **Finalize Compliance & Security Documentation**
   - **Owner:** Security Lead
   - Update PCI, privacy, and threat-model artifacts to reflect payments/CDN architecture.

4. **Operational Readiness Drills**
   - **Owner:** Operations Lead
   - Run failover drills, verify CDN rollback, queue recovery, and incident response runbooks; capture outcomes for Go-Live readiness review.
