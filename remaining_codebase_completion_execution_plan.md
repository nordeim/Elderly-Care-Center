# Remaining Codebase Completion Execution Plan

**Project:** Elderly Daycare Platform  
**Document Owner:** Lead Developer (in partnership with Product Owner)  
**Source Alignment:** `comprehensive_codebase_completion_execution_plan.md`, `codebase_completion_status_report.md`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27 (UTC+08)

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the current codebase against the original execution plan, **Phases A-F are substantially complete** with high-quality implementations. The remaining work focuses on **Phase G (Launch Hardening & Operations)** and **critical infrastructure gaps** that must be addressed before production launch.

**Key Finding:** The codebase has exceeded expectations in core functionality delivery, with robust implementations of booking, media, payments, and notification systems. The remaining work is primarily operational hardening and infrastructure completion.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **E2E Testing Delays** | High | Medium | Start immediately, parallel development |
| **Security Audit Delays** | High | Low | Book external firm early, have backup plan |
| **Performance Issues** | Medium | Low | Load test early, have scaling plan ready |
| **Accessibility Compliance** | High | Low | External audit early, internal pre-audit |

### Contingency Plans

1. **If E2E testing delayed:** Manual testing protocols with detailed checklists
2. **If security audit delayed:** Internal security review with external validation post-launch
3. **If performance issues found:** CDN optimization and horizontal scaling plan ready
4. **If accessibility issues found:** Rapid remediation team on standby
