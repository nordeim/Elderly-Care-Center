It looks like you attempted:

```bash
docker rm volumes mysql-data app-storage app-public
```

But that failed because those are volumes (or named volumes) — not containers — so `docker rm` is the wrong command (it is for removing containers).

Here’s a deeper dive + correct approach:

---

## Why your command failed

* `docker rm` is for containers, not volumes.
* To remove a volume, you should use `docker volume rm <volume_name>`. ([Docker Documentation][1])
* Also, a volume cannot be removed if it's still in use (i.e. mounted by a container). ([Docker Documentation][1])
* In docker‑compose, named volumes defined under `volumes:` are managed by Docker and persist across container recreation (unless explicitly removed). ([Stack Overflow][2])

---

## Correct way to remove those volumes

Here’s a safe sequence:

1. **Stop and remove any containers using them**

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   # or if using legacy: docker-compose down
   ```

   Using `down` will stop and remove the containers, networks, and *optionally* volumes (depending on flags).

2. **If using compose, remove volumes via the `-v` flag**

   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   ```

   The `-v` (or `--volumes`) flag tells Docker Compose to remove the volumes declared in the `volumes:` section of your `docker-compose.yml`. ([Stack Overflow][2])

3. **Manually remove specific volumes (if needed)**

   * List volumes to see their actual names:

     ```bash
     docker volume ls
     ```

   * Remove the named volume(s):

     ```bash
     docker volume rm mysql-data app-storage app-public
     ```

   * If Docker refuses because it's “in use,” ensure all containers using them are stopped/removed, then retry (or use `-f` to force, though that can be risky). ([Docker Documentation][1])

4. **Remove all dangling / unused volumes (optional cleanup)**

   If you want to clean up volumes that are not currently used by any container:

   ```bash
   docker volume prune
   ```

   This removes all unused volumes (you’ll be prompted for confirmation). ([Stack Overflow][3])

## Example in your context

Given your `docker-compose.yml`:

* The volumes are named `mysql-data`, `app-storage`, `app-public`.

* You should run:

  ```bash
  # Bring down containers and optionally remove volumes
  docker compose down -v

  # Or, if you want to explicitly remove post-facto:
  docker volume ls
  docker volume rm mysql-data app-storage app-public
  ```

* If one of those is still “in use,” you’ll get an error; then you must stop/remove the container using it and retry.

If you like, I can help you write a small shell script or alias to clean up volumes automatically in this kind of project setup. Do you want me to help with that?

Given your `docker‑compose.yml`, to run `php artisan test` *inside* the `app` service container, a correct syntax would be:

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan test
```

(or if you use the old command form)

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan test
```

If you want the container to start fresh (e.g. not using an already running container) and then run the test, you could use:

```bash
docker compose run --rm app php artisan test
```

A few caveats / enhancements:

* Use `exec` when the container is already running (less overhead).
* Use `--rm` with `run` so the temporary container is cleaned up.
* If your `app` container’s entrypoint or command overrides things, ensure the test command is valid in context.
* You might also want to set the environment to `testing` when running tests, e.g.:

  ```bash
  docker compose exec app php artisan test --env=testing
  ```
