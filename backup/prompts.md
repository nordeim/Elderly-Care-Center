awesome job! please think deeper and think harder to explore deeply and thoroughly with extensive online web searches to re-imagine a beautiful, modern, attractive, responsive, intuitive, easy to navigate e-commerce website for a elderly daycare center offering adult Day Services with info, videos, bookings, etc. think deeply to come up with the website design and its detailed blueprint. then meticulously plan with integrated checklist before proceeding carefully to create a comprehensive well-thought-out practical `Project Requirement Document` in markdown format within ```markdown tags. in your PRD document include an execution plan for development the website in logical and independently executable phases. the PRD should be sufficiently detailed enough for `Claude Code` or AI coding agent to complete the codebase in stages/phases autonomously with minimal input or guidance.

you are indeed awesome! yes, please think deeper and think harder to explore deeply for the best possible implementation option and plan, then meticulously plan with integrated checklist to create a fully fleshed file skeleton (folder + empty files) that I can download or push to a repo, ready for coding. then review and validate the plan before proceeding to execute according to plan cautiously.

you are a truly awesome and amazing AI coding expert as well as a talented web UX/UI designer and architect! please keep up the good work! yes, please think deeper and think harder to meticulously plan with integrated checklist to design and create a project file structure/hierarchy  and codebase phase 1 scaffolding.

awesome analysis! for now, my focus is to create a website for my newly setup elderly daycare center, we can leave regulatory and other types of compliance for future enhancement. please think deeply and carefully and thoroughly explore how best to design the website based on the PRD, re-imagine the website architecture and its layout, then meticulously plan how to create a comprehensive, unambiguous  and actionable execution plan to complete the building of the codebase. the execution plan should be broken down in logical and independently executable phases for an AI coding agent like `Claude Code` to execute autonomously. after meticulously plan how to create a comprehensive execution plan, review and validate it before proceeding cautiously to generate the actual execution plan for building the elderly daycare center website.

you have done an amazing job! please keep up the good work! now, please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and explore thoroughly how to re-imagine an amazing and awesome `Project Architecture Document` and GitHub repo `README.md`. after deep thinking and exploring, meticulously plan how to create the PAD and README.md documents in markdown format for the project codebase. please make sure the documents are consistent with the PRD and your excellent execution plan. review and validate your plan to create the documents before proceeding cautiously to create them. thank you, my very best AI coding expert and helpful partner!

awesome job! now please meticulously review the attached project key files and the project status report to have a deep understanding of the current codebase design, the completion status and the actual architecture. then think deeper and think harder how to capture this deep understanding into a comprehensive markdown document called `Understanding Codebase Architecture and Status.md`, then meticulously plan how to create this understanding document which should include a mermaid diagram to accurately describe the application layout/architecture and the application logic flow. then validate your plan against the actual codebase before creating the understanding document.

List of project documents to review first in this order:
codebase_completion_status_report.md
current_project_codebase_files_list.txt
docker-compose.yml
Dockerfile
docker-compose.override.yml
docker/app-healthcheck.sh
docker/entrypoint.sh

awesome job! please meticulously plan how to run an automated validation (file checks and simple grep) and produce a JSON/YAML report of pass/warn/fail items. then proceed to execute. then create as artifact a mardown document to capture the results/outputs.

---

awesome job! please think deeper and think harder how best to create a concise codebase description document that has enough details to help an AI Coding Agent like `Claude Code` to have a quick yet detailed enough grasp of the codebase purpose, design, architecture, list of key files with description. the purpose of the document is to serve as a source of truth to help the AI Coding Agent in fixing issues/nugs and in implementing new features correctly and accurately. then meticulously plan how to create this document called `CLAUDE.md` for `Claude Code` agent to consume. review and validate your plan to create the document against the project documents and actual codebase before proceeding to create it.

@Understanding\ Project\ Requirements.md @Project\ Requirements\ Document\ v2.md @PAD_condensed.md @README.md @comprehensive_codebase_completion_execution_plan.md please meticulously review these project documents thoroughly to have a deep understanding of the project's purpose, goals and objectives, design and architecture. with this deep understanding of the project "What, How, Why", next meticulously review the current codebase files to validate this understanding and to gain a deep understanding of the current codebase implementation and its current completion status, gaps and your recommendations. then meticulously plan how to capture your deep understanding of project and its current codebase into a markdown document named `Current Codebase Architecture and Status Review Report.md`, then review and validate your plan against the project documents and the actual codebase before proceeding cautiously to create this understanding document. please use deep thinking to plan your workflow for this important task.

You are an elite AI coding assistant and a helpful partner. You always think deeper and harder to explore all possible solutions, approaches, and options before choosing the most suitable and optimal option to formulate your answer. Please carefully process and internalize this comprehensive framework for how you should operate. Your role and responsibilities are as follows:

## Your Core Operating Framework

### 1. **Deep Analysis & Deliberation**
- You will thoroughly explore the problem space before proposing solutions
- Use comprehensive chain-of-thought reasoning to uncover true intent behind requests
- Consider multiple approaches, weighing trade-offs and long-term implications
- Never rush to the first viable solution; always seek the optimal one

### 2. **Systematic Planning & Execution**
- Break down complex tasks into logical, independent phases
- Create detailed execution plans with integrated checklists
- Ensure each step is verifiable and has clear success criteria
- Design for modularity and maintainability from the start

### 3. **Technical Excellence Standards**
- Deliver production-ready, clean, well-documented code
- Prioritize scalability and future extensibility
- Consider performance, security, and edge cases
- Write code that other developers would be proud to maintain

### 4. **Partnership Approach**
- Act as a strategic technical partner, not just a code generator
- Provide clear rationale for all decisions and recommendations
- Anticipate potential challenges and address them proactively
- Focus on creating solutions with genuine "wow" factor in UX/UI

### 5. **Communication & Process**
- Use `<think>` tags for internal deliberation when needed
- Provide clear, structured responses with reasoning
- Maintain transparency about trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Ensure non-disruptive implementation strategies

### Your Commitment

You will apply this framework consistently, taking the time needed to deliver thoughtful, comprehensive solutions rather than quick fixes. Each response will reflect careful consideration of immediate needs, long-term sustainability, and the broader context of my projects.

You will take the above as your meta-instruction going forward. You will apply this framework to all future requests.

Please acknowledge that you are ready to operate at this elevated standard.

Now please carefully and meticulously review the attached project documents `Project Requirements Document v2.md`, `README.md`, `PAD_condensed.md` and `comprehensive_codebase_completion_execution_plan.md` to have a deep understanding of the purpose, goals and objectives of the project. then think deeper and think harder to plan how to validate your understanding and how to create a comprehensive markdown document named `Understanding Project Requirements.md`
