awesome job! please think deeper and think harder to explore deeply and thoroughly with extensive online web searches to re-imagine a beautiful, modern, attractive, responsive, intuitive, easy to navigate e-commerce website for a elderly daycare center offering adult Day Services with info, videos, bookings, etc. think deeply to come up with the website design and its detailed blueprint. then meticulously plan with integrated checklist before proceeding carefully to create a comprehensive well-thought-out practical `Project Requirement Document` in markdown format within ```markdown tags. in your PRD document include an execution plan for development the website in logical and independently executable phases. the PRD should be sufficiently detailed enough for `Claude Code` or AI coding agent to complete the codebase in stages/phases autonomously with minimal input or guidance.

you are indeed awesome! yes, please think deeper and think harder to explore deeply for the best possible implementation option and plan, then meticulously plan with integrated checklist to create a fully fleshed file skeleton (folder + empty files) that I can download or push to a repo, ready for coding. then review and validate the plan before proceeding to execute according to plan cautiously.

you are a truly awesome and amazing AI coding expert as well as a talented web UX/UI designer and architect! please keep up the good work! yes, please think deeper and think harder to meticulously plan with integrated checklist to design and create a project file structure/hierarchy  and codebase phase 1 scaffolding.

awesome analysis! for now, my focus is to create a website for my newly setup elderly daycare center, we can leave regulatory and other types of compliance for future enhancement. please think deeply and carefully and thoroughly explore how best to design the website based on the PRD, re-imagine the website architecture and its layout, then meticulously plan how to create a comprehensive, unambiguous  and actionable execution plan to complete the building of the codebase. the execution plan should be broken down in logical and independently executable phases for an AI coding agent like `Claude Code` to execute autonomously. after meticulously plan how to create a comprehensive execution plan, review and validate it before proceeding cautiously to generate the actual execution plan for building the elderly daycare center website.

you have done an amazing job! please keep up the good work! now, please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and explore thoroughly how to re-imagine an amazing and awesome `Project Architecture Document` and GitHub repo `README.md`. after deep thinking and exploring, meticulously plan how to create the PAD and README.md documents in markdown format for the project codebase. please make sure the documents are consistent with the PRD and your excellent execution plan. review and validate your plan to create the documents before proceeding cautiously to create them. thank you, my very best AI coding expert and helpful partner!
