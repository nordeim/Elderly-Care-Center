### Executive summary

The project is tracking ahead of earlier reports: Phases A–E are now marked complete with concrete files, jobs, views, and tests in place; Phase F (Payments, Analytics, CDN) has an explicit sub-plan ready with migrations, services, controllers, dashboards, Terraform modules, and validation criteria; Phase G (Launch hardening) remains pending. Key gaps include Grafana dashboards not yet rolled out, browser-based E2E/accessibility CI automation still deferred, and payments/CDN infrastructure awaiting execution. Overall confidence is moderate to high for the delivered scope, contingent on Phase F execution and CI observability expansion.

### Current status by phase

| Phase | Planned focus | Reported status | Highlights |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Governance and inception | Completed | Governance matrix, compliance docs, CI bootstrap in place |
| B | Foundation and auth | Completed (baseline) with gaps | Sanctum-based auth, rate limiting, Docker+Prometheus; missing Grafana dashboards and full CI tests |
| C | Public content and booking MVP | Major functionality | Booking flow, admin inbox, migrations, accessibility assets; pending E2E tests and performance benchmarks |
| D | Media pipeline and trust builders | Completed | Media ingestion/transcoding, virus scanning, captions/transcripts, virtual tour components, metrics |
| E | Accounts, notifications, calendars | Completed | Caregiver dashboard, reminders, iCal export, audit logs, metrics, feature tests, runbooks |
| F | Payments, analytics, scale | Not started | Stripe integration, analytics dashboards, CDN Terraform, load testing plan defined |
| G | Launch hardening and operations | Not started | Audits, incident drills, go-live checklist planned |

### Consistency checks across documents

- **Phase E “completed” vs outstanding items:** The status report lists Phase E as completed with caregiver dashboards, reminder jobs, calendar exports, audit logs, metrics, and feature tests. The Phase E sub-plan details the exact controllers, views, migrations, notification classes, jobs, configs, email templates, services, tests, and runbooks, matching artifacts cited in the status report. This indicates high alignment and traceability between plan and delivered code, including observability docs and usability validation.

- **Phase F readiness:** The Phase F sub-plan provides a migration for payments, Stripe service abstraction, checkout and webhook controllers, payment model and feature tests, analytics controllers/views, Grafana dashboard JSON, KPI definitions, and CDN Terraform modules and ops docs. These are coherent with the execution plan’s objectives and directly address the status report’s callouts (payments readiness, Grafana rollout, and load testing).

- **Observability continuity:** Prometheus metrics are reported as exposed for booking, media, and notifications, with runbooks published. Grafana dashboards are noted as pending in the status report, and Phase F includes dashboard JSON and alert metadata, closing the loop. This supports a seamless handoff to Ops once Phase F artifacts are implemented.

### Risks and blockers

- **Grafana and alert wiring gap:** Metrics exist via Prometheus, but dashboards and alert routing are not yet delivered, risking low operational visibility until Phase F completes. Accelerate dashboard import and alert configuration in staging to reduce observability debt pre-payments go-live.

- **Test automation lag (browser/E2E and axe):** Feature tests are present for media, notifications, calendar, and bookings, but browser-based E2E and automated accessibility checks are deferred. This leaves critical flows (checkout, booking confirmation) vulnerable to regressions once Phase F introduces new UX and integrations.

- **Payments orchestration and idempotency:** While the sub-plan calls for webhook verification and audit logging, idempotency keys and compensating actions are crucial to prevent double processing and orphaned states; ensure handlers are idempotent and reconciliation jobs exist, especially under webhook retries/timeouts.

- **CDN provisioning and cost controls:** CDN Terraform modules are well scoped, but rolling out multi-environment configurations with logging, cache policies, and cost monitoring must be validated against media traffic patterns to avoid overruns. Explicit cache invalidation runbooks and performance targets are planned but need execution and measurement.

- **Timezone/DST handling for reminders and calendars:** Phase E includes timezone fields and preferences, yet cross-timezone scheduling accuracy requires strict UTC storage and robust conversion logic, which tests do cover; keep these tests green as notifications and payment scheduling tighten latencies.

### Recommendations and immediate next steps

- **Stand up Grafana in staging now:** Import the booking funnel dashboard, wire Prometheus alerts for booking latency, payment success/failure, notification success, and media backlog. Validate alert routes and runbook links before payments go live.

- **Integrate Cypress + axe-core into CI:** Target booking, caregiver dashboard, payments checkout, and media player for E2E coverage. Set merge-blocking thresholds for accessibility violations on key pages to prevent regressions during Phase F rollout.

- **Implement idempotency and reconciliation:** Add idempotency keys to payments (intent creation, webhook handlers) and create a scheduled reconciliation job that compares Stripe truth against local Payment records, logging anomalies and triggering compensating actions with audit entries.

- **Execute CDN provisioning in staging:** Apply Terraform for the CDN module, validate origin access, TLS, caching behavior, logging, and route53 records. Run the load testing script and confirm p95 targets, capturing artifacts and integrating breach exits into CI where appropriate.

- **Lock down privacy and consent UI:** Revisit consent, privacy notices, and data minimization in notifications and payments flow per compliance docs referenced in the status report; add acceptance checkpoints before Phase F exit to avoid late compliance churn.

### Validation checkpoints to close Phase F

- **Payments:** Successful deposit flow with hosted Stripe checkout; webhook signature verification and idempotent state transitions; audit logs and notifications firing; feature tests green with faked Stripe client; PCI scope documented and signed off.

- **Analytics:** Admin analytics page rendering KPIs with correct authorization and seeded data; Grafana dashboards live with alert thresholds; KPI definitions documented and versioned.

- **CDN & performance:** CDN delivering media with validated cache behavior; load tests meeting p95 latency targets for booking and media flows; ops docs for cache invalidation and cost monitoring completed; CI integrating threshold breach exits via the provided script.

- **Observability & QA:** Prometheus endpoints expose payment metrics; dashboards imported and alerts routed; Cypress+axe CI stable across core flows; runbooks updated with payment and CDN sections.

If you want, I can turn this into a sprint-ready checklist with explicit Docker/Compose healthchecks, startup validation scripts, and config contract tests tailored to your operational standards.
