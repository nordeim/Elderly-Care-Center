AI Agent Context: Elderly Daycare Platform
Purpose: This document is the source of truth for AI agents interacting with this codebase. It provides a concise, factual overview of the project's architecture, key files, and development conventions to ensure accurate and consistent code modification.

1. Technical Vitals
| Attribute | Value | Location / Confirmation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend Framework | Laravel 12 | `composer.json` |
| PHP Version | 8.4 | `README.md` |
| Primary Database | MariaDB | `docker-compose.yml` |
| Caching / Queues | Redis | `config/queue.php`, `config/cache.php` |
| Frontend Stack | TailwindCSS, Alpine.js (via Blade) | `package.json`, `PAD_condensed.md` |
| Dev Environment | Docker | `docker-compose.yml` |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | `.github/workflows/` |

2. Architecture Overview
There is a critical divergence between the planned architecture and the current implementation.

2.1. Intended Architecture (from Planning Docs)
- **Pattern**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with business logic organized into modules.
- **Directory Structure**: `app/Domain/{Booking}`, `app/Domain/{Media}`, etc.
- **Frontend**: Highly interactive, server-side rendered via Livewire components.

2.2. Current Implemented Architecture
- **Pattern**: Standard Laravel Model-View-Controller (MVC).
- **Directory Structure**: `app/Http/Controllers`, `app/Models`, `app/Services`. The `app/Domain` directory does not exist.
- **Frontend**: Traditional Blade templates. There are no Livewire components.

2.3. ðŸ”´ Guidance for AI Agent ðŸ”´
- **Adhere to the CURRENT (MVC) architecture.**
- **DO NOT** create Livewire components unless explicitly instructed to begin a migration.
- **DO NOT** create files in an `app/Domain` structure.
- Place new business logic inside single-purpose Action classes (`app/Actions`) or Service classes (`app/Services`).
- Place new controllers in `app/Http/Controllers`.
- This ensures consistency with the existing codebase.

3. Building and Running the Application
The project uses a Docker-based development environment. The `docker/entrypoint.sh` script automates most setup tasks on container startup.

3.1. Standard Docker Workflow (Recommended)
This is the primary and most reliable way to run the application. The entrypoint script handles key generation, migrations, and cache building automatically.

```bash
# 1. Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Start all services in the background.
#    The entrypoint script will handle the rest.
docker-compose up -d

# The application will be available at http://localhost
# You can now run tests or develop.
```

3.2. Manual Setup Steps (For Understanding or Debugging)
These are the individual commands the entrypoint script executes. You typically **do not need to run these manually**, but they are provided for clarity and troubleshooting.

```bash
# After `docker-compose up -d`, you can exec into the app container
# to run these commands manually if needed.

# Install PHP and JS dependencies
docker-compose exec app composer install
docker-compose exec app npm install

# The entrypoint generates this if missing, but you can force it
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate

# The entrypoint runs this, but you can re-run to refresh data
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed

# Build frontend assets for production
docker-compose exec app npm run build

# Start the Vite development server for hot-reloading during frontend work
docker-compose exec app npm run dev
```

3.3. Running Tests
All test commands must be run from within the `app` container.

```bash
# Run the entire test suite
docker-compose exec app php artisan test

# Run the specific test for the core booking flow
docker-compose exec app php artisan test --filter=CreateBookingTest
```

4. Key Directories & Files
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Site/` | Public-facing controllers for pages like Home, Services, and the Booking form. |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/` | Controllers for the admin panel (e.g., `BookingInboxController`). |
| `app/Models/` | Contains all Eloquent models. This is the data layer and is well-aligned with the database schema. |
| `app/Actions/` | Primary location for core business logic. Contains single-responsibility classes that execute key operations. |
| `app/Actions/Bookings/CreateBookingAction.php` | CRITICAL FILE: Contains the primary logic for creating a new booking. |
| `app/Jobs/` | Queued jobs for asynchronous tasks like sending notifications (`SendReminderJob`) and media processing (`TranscodeJob`). |
| `database/migrations/` | Contains all database schema definitions. This is the source of truth for the data structure. |
| `config/booking.php`, `config/media.php` | Custom configuration files for application-specific settings. |
| `tests/Feature/` | Primary location for tests. Contains feature tests that validate application workflows. |
| `tests/Feature/Bookings/CreateBookingTest.php` | The main test file for the booking creation process. |

5. Core Logic Walkthrough: The Booking Flow
This is the most critical user journey. Understanding this flow is key to working with the codebase.
- **Route Definition**: A `POST` request to `/booking` is defined in `routes/web.php`.
- **Controller Entrypoint**: The request is handled by the `store` method in `app/Http/Controllers/Site/BookingController.php`.
- **Validation**: The incoming data is validated by `app/Http/Requests/CreateBookingRequest.php`.
- **Core Business Logic**: The controller dispatches the validated data to `app/Actions/Bookings/CreateBookingAction.php`. This Action class contains the logic for checking availability, creating the `Booking` and `BookingSlot` records, and locking capacity.
- **Database Interaction**: The Action uses Eloquent models like `Booking.php` and `BookingSlot.php` to persist data.
- **Post-Booking Event**: An event is fired to trigger side-effects, such as sending a confirmation email (handled by a queued listener or job).

6. Key Data Structures (Models)
| Model | Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `User` | `users` | Stores staff and admin accounts. |
| `Client` | `clients` | Stores information about the elderly individuals. |
| `Service` | `services` | Defines the daycare services offered (e.g., "Half-Day Care"). |
| `BookingSlot` | `booking_slots` | Represents an available time slot for a specific service and facility. This is the core of the availability system. |
| `Booking` | `bookings` | Represents a confirmed booking made by a client for a specific slot. |
| `MediaItem` | `media_items` | Stores metadata for uploaded photos and videos. |
| `AuditLog` | `audit_logs` | Records significant actions performed by administrators. |
