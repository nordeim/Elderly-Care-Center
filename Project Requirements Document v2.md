## 3. Personas, needs and detailed user journeys (with validation requirements)

This section describes each primary persona, their goals and explicit validation activities required in each development phase.

### Persona A — Family Caregiver

* **Profile:** 40–65, responsible for an elderly family member, researches care options, values trust and clarity, prefers mobile web.
* **Primary goals:** Find services, view staff credibility and facility, book a visit, receive confirmations/reminders.
* **Pain points:** Complex forms, confusing scheduling language, small text and poor contrast.
* **Journey:** Search → Service page → Virtual tour / staff bios → Availability → Book visit → Receive email/SMS confirmation → Attend.
* **Validation:** In every phase that touches discovery or booking, run 3–5 moderated usability sessions with family caregiver participants covering mobile and desktop. Capture task success rates and time-on-task.

### Persona B — Prospective Adult Client (Elderly Individual)

* **Profile:** 65+, may have reduced vision/hearing, prefers simple language and large UI elements.
* **Primary goals:** Understand the environment, feel reassured, learn routines and meals, join activities.
* **Pain points:** Cognitive load from long text, inaccessible media, confusing navigation.
* **Journey:** Discover → Accessible content (large fonts, voice) → Request visit with caregiver assistance → Visit.
* **Validation:** Conduct 3–6 moderated sessions focused on accessibility: screen reader navigation, keyboard navigation, large text readability. Record errors and required fixes.

### Persona C — Center Admin / Caregiver (Internal Staff)

* **Profile:** Non-technical staff who need to manage bookings, check-in attendees, and view reports.
* **Primary goals:** Low-friction booking management, clear schedule view, export/report capabilities.
* **Pain points:** Slow UIs, complex admin pages, unclear conflict resolution for double-booked slots.
* **Journey:** Login → Dashboard → Manage bookings → Update statuses → Export reports.
* **Validation:** Run 2–4 hands-on sessions with center staff using staging system; confirm that average task completion time meets SLA (e.g., < 3 minutes to record attendance) and that conflict scenarios are handled gracefully.

### Persona D — Referral Agency / Social Worker

* **Profile:** Uses referrals frequently and needs speedy verification and downloadable resources.
* **Primary goals:** Verify credentials, find availability quickly, download forms.
* **Validation:** 2–3 sessions verifying ease of credential lookup and resource download.

**User validation program (mandatory):** For every major release (end of Phases 1–4), conduct a validation cycle that includes:

1. Recruit at least 5 users from target personas (minimum one elderly client and one caregiver per cycle).
2. Run moderated tasks (in-person or remote) with standardized scripts.
3. Measure task completion, errors, SUS (System Usability Scale) or equivalent, and record qualitative feedback.
4. Fix high-severity usability issues before public launch of that phase.

All validation results are recorded in a user-validation report that becomes part of the acceptance criteria for each phase.

---

## 5. Technical architecture & recommended stack

**Design principles:** API-first, progressive enhancement, security by default, accessibility-first, horizontal scalability for web and media workers, and immutable deployments.

**Recommended stack:**

* **Backend:** Laravel (API-first), PHP 8.x stable release.
* **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Blade templating, Progressive Web App service worker.
* **Database:** MariaDB 11.x or PostgreSQL; use read replicas for scale.
* **Cache / Queue:** Redis for sessions and background jobs.
* **Media & Storage:** S3-compatible object store for masters and renditions; CDN for media delivery.
* **Transcoding:** Autoscaled ffmpeg worker pool (containerized), orchestrated by a job queue.
* **Observability:** Prometheus for metrics, Grafana dashboards, OpenTelemetry for traces, Sentry for errors.
* **CI/CD & Infra:** GitHub Actions for CI, container images built and pushed to registry, deploy to Kubernetes or managed container service.
* **Security:** Secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS), WAF, and automated dependency scanning.

**Component interactions:** The frontend consumes backend APIs for dynamic data. Media uploads are accepted via signed upload URLs to object store; media workers pull jobs from queue for transcoding; renditions are written back to object store and served via CDN.

---

* Logs: system logs searchable for 30 days; audit logs retained 12 months.

---

## 7. Security & privacy — decision flow and concrete controls

**Decision flow (execute during Phase 0):**

1. **Data map:** Enumerate all personal data fields collected or processed (names, contact, health notes, special needs, medical alerts, images/videos). Document storage locations and access paths.
2. **Scope check:** Determine if any of the collected data qualifies as PHI under HIPAA or as special categories under GDPR. If yes, proceed with HIPAA/GDPR workstreams.
3. **Workstreams:** If PHI or GDPR in-scope, execute the following immediately:

   * Sign Data Processing Agreements (DPA) with all subprocessors.
   * Establish Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with hosting provider if PHI.
   * Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).
   * Appoint Data Protection Officer (DPO) or designate responsible person.
   * Implement enhanced logging (immutable audit logs), access review cadence, and mandatory privacy training.
4. **If not in scope:** Document the assessment, implement baseline privacy measures, and review annually.

**Concrete technical controls:**

* TLS + HSTS + CSP, secure cookies, and same-site flags.
* Encryption at rest: use cloud KMS-managed keys or equivalent; rotate keys annually.
* Data minimization: store only fields required for service delivery.
* Audit logging: record who accessed or modified personal records, with timestamps and reason.
* RBAC: separate roles (admin, staff, caregiver) with least privilege.
* Secrets management and periodic rotation.

**Security testing and cadence:**

* SAST and dependency scanning on every merge request.
* DAST (dynamic scanning) against staging on every release candidate.
* External penetration test against production-like environment prior to public launch and at least annually thereafter.
* Vulnerability triage process: critical issues fixed before release; high issues to be scheduled within 7 days with documented risk acceptance if deferred.

---

## 8. Accessibility & UX standards — test plan and recruitment

**Standards:** WCAG 2.1 AA baseline is mandatory for all production flows. Adopt WCAG 2.2 AA where feasible.

**Design rules:**

* Base font size at minimum 18px for body; scalable text with REMs.
* Contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for body text and ≥ 3:1 for large text.
* Focus-visible styles, skip-to-content links, clear form labels and large touch targets (≥ 44px).
* Captions and transcripts for all video/audio content.

**Automated testing:** Use axe-core in CI; fail build for critical accessibility violations on critical paths.

**Manual testing:** Each release candidate undergoes keyboard-only and screen-reader checks on the primary booking and admin flows.

**User research & recruitment plan:** Maintain a roster of test participants (minimum 10 over project lifecycle) including elderly individuals with varying levels of digital comfort and caregivers. Recruit via partner centers or local community groups. Compensate participants fairly.

**Acceptance criteria (accessibility):** Critical flows pass automated tests and manual checks; no critical WCAG violations remain unresolved at launch.

---

## 9. Media ingestion, processing and storage lifecycle

**Ingest pipeline:**

* Users upload media via signed upload URLs to object storage (pre-signed PUT).
* Ingest worker validates file type, scans for viruses, and extracts metadata.
* Transcode jobs are enqueued for ffmpeg workers.

**Transcoding ABR ladder (recommended):**

* 1080p (1920x1080) — 4500 kbps
* 720p  (1280x720)  — 2500 kbps
* 480p  (854x480)   — 1200 kbps
* 360p  (640x360)   — 700 kbps
* 240p  (426x240)   — 300 kbps

**Captions & transcripts:**

* Perform automated speech-to-text on ingest and produce captions (.vtt) and transcripts.
* Human review/QA of captions for published content (editorial process) before public release of testimonial videos.

**Storage lifecycle & cost controls:**

* Hot storage: recent media and renditions for 30 days.
* Warm storage: standard object storage for 30–90 days.
* Cold archive: object archive (Glacier or equivalent) for assets older than 90 days per retention policy.
* Implement lifecycle rules to transition objects according to policy.

**Delivery:** Serve renditions via CDN with signed URLs for private material; cache public assets aggressively.

**Operational thresholds:**

* If media conversion backlog > 50 pending for > 1 hour, escalate to operations to add workers or investigate failures.

---

## 10. Observability: metrics, alerts and runbooks (detailed)

**Metrics to collect (minimum):**

* `http_request_duration_seconds` (labels: route, method, status\_code) — histograms for latency.
* `http_request_errors_total` (labels: route, status\_code) — counters for error rates.
* `booking_endpoint_latency_seconds` (labels: status) — booking-specific histogram.
* `booking_funnel_stage_total` (labels: stage) — counters for funnel stages.
* `queue_jobs_pending` (labels: queue) — gauge for queue depth.
* `media_conversion_backlog` — gauge for pending transcode jobs.
* `db_slow_queries_total` — counter for slow queries.
* `redis_memory_bytes` and `db_connection_count` — gauges for infra health.

**Alerting thresholds and priorities:**

* **P0:** `http_5xx_ratio > 2%` for 5 minutes → immediate paging. Steps: examine errors in Sentry, check last deploy, roll back if necessary.
* **P1:** `booking_endpoint_p95_latency > 2.5s` for 10 minutes → page on-call. Steps: check DB slow queries, cache hit rates, queue backlogs.
* **P2:** `media_conversion_backlog > 50` for 60 minutes → page operations team. Steps: scale workers, check ffmpeg logs.

**Runbook — P0 5xx spike (executable steps):**

1. Acknowledge alert and collect context (time, affected routes, error codes).
2. Open error monitoring and identify top failing endpoint and stack traces.
3. Check deploy history for recent releases; if release correlates, temporarily block new deployments and consider rollback.
4. If rollback is chosen: execute `scripts/rollback.sh <previous-tag>` and re-run smoke tests.
5. Post-mortem: after restore, create incident report containing root cause, impact, remediation and timeline.

**Runbook — Booking latency incident:**

1. Inspect booking endpoint p95 latency graphs.
2. Run slow query diagnostics on DB and inspect top queries.
3. Check Redis metrics and cache miss/hit rates; warm caches if needed.
4. If DB is primary cause, consider scaling read replicas or adding targeted indexes and plan migration in maintenance window.
5. Run load test for the booking flow in a staging environment to validate fix.

**Operational play:** On-call schedule should be defined and rotated weekly. All runbook actions must be logged in incident tracker with time stamps and actor names.

---

## 11. CI/CD, security gates and release strategy

**CI pipeline (per PR):**

* Lint and formatting checks.
* Unit tests and integration tests.
* Static analysis: PHPStan/PSalm.
* Dependency scanning and secret scanning.
* DAST (OWASP ZAP) run against ephemeral staging environment (for release candidates).
* Accessibility automated checks (axe-core) on critical pages.

**Gates:** Merge to main blocked if any of the following fail: unit tests, SAST results with critical errors, secret scan, dependency scan with critical vulnerabilities.

**Release flow:**

* Build immutable container image and tag with semantic version.
* Deploy to staging and run smoke and E2E tests.
* Roll out to canary (5–10% traffic) and monitor metrics for 15–30 minutes.
* Promote to full production or perform blue/green switch if available.

**Rollback:** All releases must be rollback-capable via previous image tag. Rollback procedure must be automated via scripts.

**Infrastructure as code:** All infra changes go through code review; use Terraform or equivalent for cloud resources.

---

## 12. Testing & quality assurance strategy

**Automated tests:**

* Unit tests for models and services.
* Integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions.
* E2E tests (Cypress) for booking and admin flows.
* Accessibility tests (axe) in CI.

**Performance & load testing:**

* Use k6 or Gatling for booking scenario tests. Validate p95 latencies under realistic concurrency.

**Security testing:**

* SAST (GitHub Actions), DAST on staging, dependency scanning, periodic SCA.
* External penetration test prior to public launch and annually.

**QA cadence:** QA runs nightly regression suite on staging; release candidate tested by QA with exploratory testing sessions.

---

## 13. Integrations & API security

**Primary integrations:**

* Calendar export: iCal and Google Calendar integration for booking invites.
* SMS: Twilio or local SMS provider for reminders.
* Email: Provider such as Amazon SES or SendGrid with templated transactional emails.
* Payments: Stripe hosted checkout to avoid PCI scope.
* EHR/FHIR: Only if strictly required; must be gated behind legal review and explicit consent flows.

**API security principles:**

* Use short-lived tokens for service-to-service communication; store secrets in a secrets manager.
* Enforce least privilege on integration keys; rotate keys quarterly.
* All external webhooks must be signed and verified.

---

## 14. Offline resilience, PWA design and sync strategy

**Goals:** Provide read access to schedules and client notes for caregivers in low-connectivity settings, and allow queued booking actions that sync when online.

**Service worker strategy:**

* Cache-first for static assets and critical UI shell.
* Network-first for dynamic schedule data with fallback to cached snapshot.
* Background sync API for queued operations with exponential backoff and conflict handling.

**Conflict resolution strategy:**

* Use optimistic concurrency tokens (version numbers) on critical resources.
* If a submit fails due to version mismatch, show a conflict UI that highlights differences and offers choices (retry, merge, contact support).

**Acceptance:** Offline queue persists across reloads; retries are visible in UI; conflicts are resolvable by staff.

---

## 15. Detailed phased execution plan (tasks, owners, acceptance)

**Team roles:** Product Owner, Lead Developer, DevOps/Observability Engineer, Security Lead, QA Lead, UX Researcher, Media Engineer, Legal/Compliance Officer, Support/Operations Lead.

Deliverable lists and acceptance criteria for Phases 0–5 are defined in Section 4. Each acceptance step must be verified by the Product Owner and QA Lead plus at least one user validation session where applicable.

**Sprint cadence:** 2-week sprints; each sprint delivers 1–2 vertical slices. Each sprint ends with a demo, a retrospective, and regression tests on staging.

**Estimation guardrails:** Plan conservatively; assume 20–30% contingency for unknowns (media issues, compliance work, accessibility fixes).

---

## 16. Deploy playbook & operational runbooks (executable steps)

**Pre-deploy checklist (execute before any production deployment):**

* Ensure CI is green for release tag.
* Confirm SAST/DAST reports: no critical vulnerabilities.
* Notify stakeholders of release window.
* Ensure background workers are scaled appropriately; drain long-running jobs if required.
* Perform database migration dry-run in staging and verify rollback path.

**Deploy commands (example flow):**

1. `docker build -t registry.example.com/elderly-platform:<tag> .`
2. `docker push registry.example.com/elderly-platform:<tag>`
3. Update deployment manifest and apply: `kubectl apply -f deployment-<tag>.yaml`
4. Run smoke tests: `scripts/smoke-tests.sh`

**Smoke check targets:** Booking create → booking list → staff login → media playback.

**Rollback command (example):**

* `scripts/rollback.sh <previous-tag>` which performs: update deployment to previous image, wait for readiness, run smoke tests.

**Incident post-mortem:** Within 72 hours produce incident report with timeline, impact, root cause analysis and remediation plan.

---

## 17. Data retention and archival policy (harmonized)

This policy balances privacy, operational needs and legal obligations.

* **Booking personal data:** Retain for 12 months after last activity; extend only with consent.
* **Special needs / medical notes:** Retain for 6 months after client exit unless required to be retained longer by law; if PHI is in-scope, follow HIPAA retention obligations.
* **Audit logs (admin actions):** Retain 12 months in immutable storage.
* **System logs (application logs):** Retain 30 days searchable; archive beyond 30 days to cold storage if necessary.
* **Database backups (snapshots):** Retain 90 days; test restores quarterly.

Deletion and anonymization procedures must be implemented to comply with data subject requests where applicable.

---

## 18. Risks, assumptions & mitigations

**Top risks:**

1. **PHI/GDPR scope discovered late** — Mitigation: execute decision flow immediately and pause public collection of sensitive fields until legal track completes.
2. **Media costs and transcoding scale** — Mitigation: use adaptive autoscaling, set quota limits on uploads, use CDN and lifecycle policies.
3. **Accessibility violations discovered late** — Mitigation: include axe in CI and run manual audits early and often; recruit users for early validation.
4. **Timeline slippage due to security remediations** — Mitigation: schedule pen-test earlier and leave buffer for remediation.

Assumptions: team has basic DevOps capability and access to cloud provider where KMS and object storage are available.

---

## 19. Governance, roles & responsibilities (no placeholders)

**Product Owner** — Responsible for product decisions, priority setting, acceptance of phases, user validation coordination, and stakeholder communication.

**Lead Developer** — Technical lead for architecture decisions, code quality, reviews, API contracts and developer onboarding.

**DevOps / Observability Engineer** — Owns CI/CD pipelines, monitoring dashboards, alert rules, runbooks, and production deployments.

**Security Lead** — Owns SAST/DAST configuration, secrets management, vulnerability triage, and coordinates external penetration tests.

**QA Lead** — Owns test plan, automated test suites, E2E tests, regression cycles and release acceptance criteria.

**UX Researcher** — Runs user validation sessions, compiles usability reports, and ensures accessibility validation is satisfied.

**Media Engineer** — Owns media ingestion pipeline, transcoding workers, caption workflow and CDN configuration.

**Legal / Compliance Officer** — Owns DPIA, DPA/BAA negotiations, privacy notices, and legal compliance signoffs.

**Support / Operations Lead** — Responsible for runbook execution during incidents, customer communications and staff training for the product.

Each role must be assigned to a named person before Phase 1 acceptance. Roles collaborate with the Product Owner to meet acceptance criteria.
